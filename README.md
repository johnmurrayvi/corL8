corL8
=====

Lightweight utility to interact with a L8 written in C.

Still a work in progress (obviously)

TODO:
 - Finish USB serial server
 - Finish bluetooth server
 - Implement non-sensor/non-ack commands
 - Create some tests/generate files to be run through stdin

Planned features:
 - Interactive command line interace
 - One-shot commands (e.g. turn off L8/silence L8)
 - Maybe some sort of GUI (I have the start of a hastily written GTK app, but I have little experience with front-end)
